/* New Year’s Eve Party Dilemma 
You are throwing a giant party at your penthouse in a 25-story building and have invited all your family 
and friends to celebrate New Year’s Eve. You have also requested services from a party planning company that 
will arrange DJs, bartenders, servers, caterers, and a band. The main entry to your penthouse is through a 
standard elevator with a weight capacity of 2,500 pounds. Since you do not want your guests taking the stairs 
to the 25th floor, you need to program your robot to determine if the elevator can support the weight of your guests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote my program using while, if and else if statements, I feel like it could be made much smaller by using a for 
and asking for the exact weight.
